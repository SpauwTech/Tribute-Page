        Monkey D. Luffy , also known as "Straw Hat" Luffy, is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the One Piece manga series, created by Eiichiro Oda.

        Born on May 5, Luffy dreamed of being a pirate since childhood. At the age of 17, Luffy sets sails from the East Blue Sea to the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure, One Piece, to succeed Gol D. Roger as King of the Pirates. Luffy, captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, recruits crew members, fights antagonists, and aids and befriends the inhabitants of several islands on his journey. Usually cheerful, he becomes serious when he fights. Luffy uses his elasticity to concentrate his power, executing a range of attacks. In his signature attack, Gum-Gum Pistol, he slingshots punches at opponents from a distance. Luffy also grows stronger over the course of the story, as reflected in his "Bounty" which is used to measure the threat he poses to the World Government. He is the grandson of Monkey D. Garp and son of Monkey D. Dragon, but was raised by Curly Dadan, his foster mother, meeting Portgas D. Ace and Sabo, his adopted brothers, in their childhood. </p>

In addition to the One Piece franchise, the character has appeared in a number of manga and anime series and collaborative video games. His critical reception has been largely positive.</p>
